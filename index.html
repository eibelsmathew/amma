                    I don’t know how you manage to be the most loving, caring, and hilarious person all at once, but somehow, you’ve mastered it like a pro. You’ve always been there for us with your magical powers—whether it's finding lost things (even when they were in front of my eyes), making the best food (seriously, how do you do it?), or just being the glue that holds everything together.

                    Another year older? Please...you look younger every year! If you weren’t my Amma, I’d be asking for your beauty secrets! 😄
                    
                    On your special day, I just want you to know how much I love you. You’re the heart of our family, the one who keeps us all grounded, and the one who always makes us laugh even in the toughest times.
                    
                    Here’s to more years of love, laughter, and the wonderful chaos that only you can manage with such grace. Happy Birthday, Amma! You’re truly one of a kind. ❤️
